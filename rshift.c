Sure, I can help you with that! Here's an example of a C program that demonstrates the right shift operation:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num = 10; // Number to be right shifted
    int shift = 2; // Number of positions to shift

    int result = num >> shift; // Right shift operation

    printf("Result: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

In this program, we have a variable `num` with a value of 10. We then use the right shift operator (`>>`) to shift the bits of `num` two positions to the right. The result is stored in the variable `result` and then printed out. Feel free to modify the values of `num` and `shift` to experiment with different right shift operations. Let me know if you have any questions! 😊👍
